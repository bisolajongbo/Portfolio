**Procurement Dashboard Analysis**

This analysis focused on procurement performance, evaluating supplier efficiency, cost savings, compliance, delivery timelines, defect rates, and price fluctuations over time. The goal was to uncover insights that help businesses reduce procurement costs, select reliable suppliers, and optimize purchasing decisions.
The dashboard was analyzed and built using Microsoft Excel, leveraging pivot tables, charts, and advanced formatting to create an interactive and insightful report for decision makers.

**Insurance Claim**

This project is focused on to building a predictive model to determine if a building will have an insurance claim during a certain period or not. I will have to predict the probability of having at least one claim over the insured period of the building. The model will be based on the building characteristics. The target variable, Claim, is a:
1 if the building has at least a claim over the insured period. 0 if the building doesn’t have a claim over the insured period..
This is built using Python, leveraging Data cleanings,EDA,Featuring Engineering,Visulazation Fixing inbalance,modelling and Evaluation.
